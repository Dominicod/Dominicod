# Hey y'all!
My name is Dominic O'Donnell;

Hello there! I am just a guy who loves building really cool applications in the best way he can. I am currently working at Seven Hills Technology creating web services in several different languages, primarily with React and C#/.NET. Outside of work, you'll find me toying with mixed reality software using Unity on my handy dandy Quest 3 or working on my web service side projects with C#/.NET.

You can find me on [Linked-In][3].
