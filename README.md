# ðŸ‘‹ Hey y'all!
My name is Dominic O'Donnell;

Currently, a Software Developer at Hone Health. My primary expertise lies in backend development with .NET and Azure. Additionally, I have a solid understanding of front-end development, particularly with React.

I am passionate about the evolving field of spatial computing. I love spending time on the weekends toying with Unity/Godot to see what I can do with this emerging technology.

Some of my skills include:
- Programming Languages: C#, JavaScript
- Frameworks & Libraries: .NET, React, jQuery
- Front-End: HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap
- Back-End: SQL Server, RESTful Development, Microservice/Event-Driven/Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Design
- Testing & Quality Assurance: XUnit, Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- DevOps & Cloud: Docker, Linux, Git, Azure Cloud & AI Services, CI/CD (CircleCI, GitHub Actions)
